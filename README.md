# applescript_dragon
A place to store AppleScripts for use with Dragon dictation software

To add a command, click on "Commands", click on "+", enter the command name (commands that take variables should be followed by a /!Diddly!/). Select "global" as the context.
Set the type to AppleScript, copy-paste the contents and save - you should be good to go!

Definitely check out repeated\_command.AppleScript for cursor movements.

Commands that take a variable (like repeated\_command.scpt) should be named `<command name> /!Diddly!/`, eg: my flexible repeated command is named `mandy /!Diddly!/`. First names work well as command names because they are highly distinctive and unlikely to be confused with other words. I also  lower case all my commands to make them easily distinguishable from the inbuilt commands.

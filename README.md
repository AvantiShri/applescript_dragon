A place to store AppleScripts for use with Dragon dictation software

Definitely check out repeated\_command.AppleScript for cursor movements.

Commands that take a variable (like numerals.scpt) should be named `<command name> /!Diddly!/`, eg: my numerals command is named `jeff /!Diddly!/`. First names work well as command names because they are highly distinctive and unlikely to be confused with other words. I also  lower case all my commands to make them easily distinguishable from the inbuilt commands.
